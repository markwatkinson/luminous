LUMINOUS REGRESSION TESTING SUITE


==Introduction==

These tests are full source files intended to detect regressions. The given
outputs aren't necessary correct or final; they have all been verified by eye
but may contain minor faults or may lack highlighting of certain features. 
They merely indicate the output of a given snapshot of Luminous. Therefore 
regressions should be easy to detect, but if a future version of Luminous 
causes the outputs to change in a good/intentional way, the given outputs will
need to be regenerated.


==Interaction/Usage==

The testing scripts require the command line-php interpretor (php-cli in 
Ubuntu/Debian), because this is the easiest way to automate interaction
with Luminous, and doesn't require a full blown HTTP server running locally

To run the tests use test.php:

$ php test.php path/to/script

The path is optional and by default targets every sub-directory in THIS 
directory. It will recurse directories.

It will print a summary to stdout. If any files do not produce the expected
output, it will write a diff of the actual vs expected output to the
directory the offending file exists in. It will be suffixed with
._diff.luminous, so as to avoid being recognised as a valid test target.
A diff comparison tool, such as Kompare for KDE, will usefully identify the
difference.

To remove existing diffs, run

$ php test.php -clean


==Regenerating Expected Output==

If expected output needs to be regenerated (i.e. a favourable change has been 
made to Luminous and the existing test files are now 'wrong'), you can 
regenerate them with the generate.php script. It is advisable to first 
generate HTML output and verify it visually,

$ php generate.php -html path/to/script

If the resulting path/to/script.html.luminous looks correct in a web browser,
then:

$ php generate.php path/to/script

NOTE: the HTML output contains absolute paths to CSS resources, so you will
have to regenerate this yourself if you need it or move your Luminous 
directory (I couldn't get relative file:// paths to work).

==Licensing==

The sources in this folder are taken from a variety of open source code. They
are not intended to be distributed to end users but are publicly available in
SVN. If there is a licensing violation please report it to the issue tracker 
at http://code.google.com/p/luminous/

==TODO==

1) We need better coverage of languages; all languages Luminous supports
should be represented in here with several non-trivially sized test files.
2) These are mostly real-world sources, we also need to add some more 
intensive, contrived sources, i.e. probable error cases.
