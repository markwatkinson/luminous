HAI

BTW this function calculates the exponential: num1^num2
HOW DUZ I POWER YR NUM1 AN YR NUM2
  I HAS A COUNTER ITZ 0
  I HAS A ACCUM ITZ 1
  IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR COUNTER WILE COUNTER SMALLR THAN NUM2?
    ACCUM R PRODUKT OF NUM1 AN ACCUM
  IM OUTTA YR LOOP
  FOUND YR ACCUM
IF U SAY SO

HOW DUZ I FACTORIAL YOUR_NUMBER
  BOTH SAEM 0 AN BIGGR OF YOUR_NUMBER AN 0, O RLY?
    YA RLY
      FOUND YR 1
    NO WAI
      FOUND YR PRODUKT OF YOUR_NUMBER AN FACTORIAL DIFF OF YOUR_NUMBER AN 1
  OIC
IF U SAY SO

HOW DUZ I SIN X

  I HAS A OUTPUT ITZ X
  I HAS A COUNTER ITZ 3
  I HAS A SIGN ITZ -1
  I HAS A LIMIT ITZ 11

  IM IN YR LOOP
    COUNTER BIGGR THAN LIMIT?, O RLY?
      YA RLY, GTFO
    OIC

    I HAS A NUMERATOR ITZ POWER X COUNTER
    I HAS A DENOMINATOR ITZ FACTORIAL COUNTER
    I HAS A TERM ITZ QUOSHUNT OF NUMERATOR AN DENOMINATOR

    TERM R PRODUKT OF TERM AN SIGN

    OUTPUT R SUM OF OUTPUT AN TERM

    COUNTER R SUM OF COUNTER AN 2
    SIGN R PRODUKT OF SIGN AN -1

  IM OUTTA YR LOOP
  FOUND YR OUTPUT
IF U SAY SO

I HAS A PI ITZ 3.14159265
VISIBLE SIN PRODUKT OF PI AN 0
VISIBLE SIN PRODUKT OF PI AN 0.25
VISIBLE SIN PRODUKT OF PI AN 0.5
VISIBLE SIN PRODUKT OF PI AN 0.75
VISIBLE SIN PI
VISIBLE SIN PRODUKT OF PI AN 1.5

KTHXBYE
