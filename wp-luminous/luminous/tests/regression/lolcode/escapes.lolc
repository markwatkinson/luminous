HAI
BTW we're going to look at some escape sequences
I HAS A VAR ITZ 12
BTW interpolation
I HAS A STR ITZ "MY VAR IS :{VAR}"
VISIBLE STR
BTW unicode
VISIBLE "---"
VISIBLE "I LIKE :(03C0)"

BTW escaping works by the : character.
BTW escaping a quote:
VISIBLE "---"
VISIBLE "I SAID :"hello:" to him"
BTW escaping newlines, and tabs
VISIBLE "---"
VISIBLE "I SAID:):>:"hello:":)to him"
KTHXBYE
