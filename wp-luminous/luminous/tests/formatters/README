                              FORMATTER TESTS

The formatter tests currently consist of:

latexformatter.php:  Tests the LaTeX output format. 

raw.php

  Luminous scanners are meant to generate data which looks a lot like XML.
  This converts it into proper XML (just involves adding root tag, a header and
  encoding) and loads it into an error intolerant XML parser to determine
  whether it is well formed or not.
  Returns 0 if successful, 1 on failure. A Log is written to 
  $LUMINOUS/tests/log/formatter_raw

  TODO now that Luminous is using individual scanners, there should be at
  least 1 test per language (use the regression database)
  


html.php [DOCTYPES...]
  Tests the HTML formatter. This generates some HTML from a pre-parsed and 
  tagged file and validates it online using the W3C validation service. 
  The output from this will NOT change as a result of a change to Luminous's 
  parsing algorithm. This tests only the HTML formatter. raw.php will test the
  parsing algorithm, as will the regression test suite.
  
  This requires  http://pear.php.net/package/Services_W3C_HTMLValidator
  (apt-get install php-pear && pear install Services_W3C_HTMLValidator), as 
  it provides a simple interface to accessing the validator.
  
  This test is SLOW! A 1-second pause is left between validation requests, and
  the data which has to be uploaded may be fairly large.
  
  Valid return codes are:
  0 : Validation passed
  1 : Failed validation - INVALID.
  2 : Some error occurred. This isn't a validation failure; this means that
      something went wrong before we managed to figure out whether it was 
      valid.  This is due to uncaught errors somewhere in 
      Services_W3C_HTMLValidator or its dependencies. This is absolutely 
      meaingless and the test will need to be repeated.
  3 : Services_W3C_HTMLValidator is not installed.
  
  Valid doctypes are:
  html4strict 
  html4loose 
  xhtml1.0strict 
  xhtml1.0loose 
  xhtml1.1
  html5
