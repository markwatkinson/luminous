==Quick Usage==

  # Extract your archive to some directory (or clone the repo, or whatever). This should be inside your document root, as the style/ directory needs to be web-visible.
  # If you downloaded a development version from GitHub (as opposed to an archive from this site), remove the tests/ directory, this is not something you want to expose on a public machine.
  # Create a directory called 'cache' inside your luminous directory and make sure it is writable to your server (this probably involves 777 permissions).
  # Now test everything is working by creating a new file, the hello world of highlighting:{{{lang=php
<?php
require_once '/path/to/luminous/luminous.php';
echo luminous::head_html(); // outputs CSS includes, intended to go in <head>
echo luminous::highlight('c', 'printf("hello world\n");');
}}}
  # Point your browser at the page you just created and it should show a single line of highlighted source code.
