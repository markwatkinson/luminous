 * @brief The base scanner classes
 *
 * This file contains the base scanning classes. All language scanners should
 * subclass one of these. They are all essentially abstract as far as Luminous
 * is concerned, but it may occasionally be useful to instantiate one.
 *
 * The classes defined here follow a simple hierarchy: Scanner defines basic
 * string scanning methods, LuminousScanner extends this with logic useful to
 * highlighting. LuminousEmbeddedWebScript adds some helpers for web languages,
 * which may be nested in other languages. LuminousSimpleScanner is a
 * generic flat scanner which is driven by token rules.
 * LuminousStatefulScanner is a generic transition table driven scanner.

/**
 * @brief the base class for all scanners
 *
 * LuminousScanner is the base class for all language scanners. Here we
 * provide a set of methods comprising a highlighting layer. This includes
 * recording a token stream, and ultimately being responsible for
 * producing some XML representing the token stream.
 *
 * We also define here some filters which rely on state information expected
 * to be recorded into the instance variables.
 *
 * Highlighting a string at this level is a four-stage process:
 *
 *      @li string() - set the string
 *      @li init() - set up the scanner
 *      @li main() - perform tokenization
 *      @li tagged() - build the XML
 *
 *
 *
 * A note on tokens: Tokens are stored as an array with the following indices:
 *    @li 0:   Token name   (e.g. 'COMMENT'
 *    @li 1:   Token string (e.g. '// foo')
 *    @li 2:   escaped? (bool) Because it's often more convenient to embed nested
 *              tokens by tagging token string, we need to escape it. This
 *              index stores whether or nto it has been escaped.
